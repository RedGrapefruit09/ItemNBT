It's available _exclusively_ for the 1.17.x versions of Minecraft.

Please read the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/RedGrapefruit09/ItemNBT/wiki).

## Code

The code is written in Java 16 (AdoptOpenJDK distribution), but is **fully Kotlin-compatible**.\
This means that you can use this library seamlessly in your Kotlin-powered mods with no nullability issues.
